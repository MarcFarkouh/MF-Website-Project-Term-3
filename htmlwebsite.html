		<h3> About me: </h3>
	<!-- This is the text illustarted on the page -->
	<p>
	My name is Marcus Farkus, I am 21 years old, and I attend Harvard University. I created this website in order for students to get access to the help they need in order to succeed. 
	This website allows students to find tutors that may assist them in improving their grades in many different subjects such as Math, Science, and languages such as English and French. 
	Below, you may customize your search in order to find the proper tutor for your child to succeed. It has always been in my best interest to help others, so this is why I created this website.
